## Backend interview

### Caveats

Since it's more a concept app, it’s perfectly fine to make some compromises:

* you can use whatever technology/framework is suitable for you (yet, please don't use a sledgehammer to crack a nut), the only interesing part is the enduser is able to run it and see the result;
      
      
Don't be neither too generic nor too specific – don't polish it too much, but also keep focus on the code as well  – your final product should be „just enough”.
* if you don't feel prepared for the job, either get familiar with languages/technologies you'd consider useful here, or let us know you're not ready for it;
* we'll notice if you've worked on it a week instead of a several hours – don't do more than it's specified in the requirements;


Your work should be available via GitHub as a public repository, commit often[2]. 

Value quality over quantity. And, finally, when in doubt – especially about the scope of the task – feel free to ask.
